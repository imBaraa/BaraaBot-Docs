- `Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ù…ÙŠÙˆØª` command: Used in groups ONLY, as an administrator, mention someone's text with this mute command and the number of minutes to be muted and they will be muted for that specific duration, mute range (1 till 4320) minutes, which is 3 Days.
- `Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù†Ù…ÙŠÙˆØª` command: Used in groups ONLY, as an administrator:
  1. write "**@someone Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù†Ù…ÙŠÙˆØª**" and they will be unmuted using their usernames.
  2. mention someone's text with this unmute command they will be unmuted (in-case this user has no username >> @someone), or just unmute them yourself.
- `Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ù‡Ø§Øª` command: acts as a resource getter for your specification.
- `Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ø­ÙˆÙ„` command: alters users messages into (bold, italic, code-shape).
- `Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ù‚Ù„Ø¯` command: this is a very creative command cause it makes the bot copy your messages (which you want the bot to say) and simultaneously deletes your messages, as i have noticed people use "Ù‚ÙˆÙ„" command to make the bot say things and then they delete their messages so i had to come up with something that takes things off your shoulder.
- `Ù„Ø§ ØªÙ‚Ù„Ø¯` command: this command stops the bot from copying you.
